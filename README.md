# MicroservicesProject
This's a .net 6 core microservices application having 3 microservices; users, customers, product microservices and a Gateway API which uses Ocelot to interface between the Upstream and Downstream. The Gateway API also handles JWT authentication and authorization. Token is generated by the Users microservice upon a client successful authentication. 
The 3 microservices make use of separate SQL database each to access their data.
The data is handled by EF core for data access and manipulation.
